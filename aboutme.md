My name is Stan Kusmier:

- I am new to Data Science
- I am currently in school for Data Science
- I am in the beautiful Upstate area of South Carolina but willing to work anywhere geographically.


### Why Data Science?

This is a quickly growing career field and that I think will continue to have a huge influence in most any industry.
