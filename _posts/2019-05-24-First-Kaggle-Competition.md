## Purpose
This is my second data science project at Lambda School where I participated in a week-long private Kaggle Challenge to predict the functonality of water pumps in Tanzania. For the record, I did not place in the top half of my class but I was able to predict a respectible accuracy by using an XGBoost classification model using both randomized search cross-validation and grid search cross-validation techniques.

This was a really fun challenge because I was able to practically apply concepts that I have learned at Lambda School with real-world data that can be used for social good.

## Tanzanian Water Pump Kaggle Challenge Overview

### Predict which water pumps are faulty.
Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, can you predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all? Predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.

This predictive modeling challenge comes from DrivenData, an organization who helps non-profits by hosting data science competitions for social impact. The competition has open licensing: "The data is available for use outside of DrivenData." We are reusing the data on Kaggle's InClass platform so we can run a weeklong challenge just for your Lambda School Data Science cohort.

The data comes from the Taarifa waterpoints dashboard, which aggregates data from the Tanzania Ministry of Water. In their own words:

_Taarifa is an open source platform for the crowd sourced reporting and triaging of infrastructure related issues. Think of it as a bug tracker for the real world which helps to engage citizens with their local government. We are currently working on an Innovation Project in Tanzania, with various partners._
