## Purpose
This is my second data science project at Lambda School where I participated in a week-long private Kaggle Challenge to predict the fun functonality of water pumps in Tanzania. For the record, I did not place in the top half of my class but I was able to predict a respectible accuracy by using an XGBoost classification model using both randomized search cross-Validation and grid search cross-validation techniques.

This was a really fun challenge because I got practically apply concepts that I have learned at Lambda School with real-world data that can be used of a social good.
